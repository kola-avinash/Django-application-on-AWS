The main scope of this project is to understand how to best utilize different cloud computing services to implement a Django application. Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. From data warehousing to deployment tools, directories to content delivery, over 200 AWS services are available. New services can be provisioned quickly, without the upfront capital expense. This allows enterprises, start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, and customers in the public sector to access the building blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirement.

The Django application that is developed for the hosting in AWS is customer registrations and tracking their orders. It is a data driven application used by the customers and admins to create, delete and update the orders of the customers. The implementation uses a tool called Django Framework which is an excellent open source web application frame work for complex data-driven website development.
